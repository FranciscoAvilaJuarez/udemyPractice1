        This year will mark the 42nd anniversary of the mind-expanding
        <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books</em>, which were first
        published in October 1979. First, the adventures of Arthur Dent, Ford
        Prefect and Marvin the Paranoid Android were transmitted over the
        airwaves, and then came Douglas Adams' five science fiction books set in
        the Hitchhiker’s universe, which have inspired stage plays, TV shows and
        film adaptations, as well as an annual day of celebration every 25 May.
        If you're not already up to speed, superfan Jean Menzies has everything
        you need to know about
        <em> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy books</em>.
