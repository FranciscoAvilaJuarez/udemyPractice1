                            genius' - David Walliams An international phenomenon and pop-culture

                        Arthur, however, is saved from certain death when Ford sticks out his thumb and hitches them a ride on the very ships about to destroy the Earth. Dragged into outer space by an intergalactic hitchhiker, Arthur is about to be faced with despondent robots, ear-splitting alien poetry and, perhaps most surprisingly of all, the woman who he had been kicking himself for not asking on a date at a party six months earlier. And during the course of their riotous adventures Arthur and co will learn the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything: 42.

                        It's an ordinary Thursday lunchtime for Arthur Dent until his house gets
                        demolished. The Earth follows shortly afterwards to make way for a new
                        hyperspace express route, and his best friend has just announced that he's
                        an alien. At this moment, they're hurtling through space with nothing but
                        their towels and an innocuous-looking book inscribed, in large friendly
                        letters, with the words:
                    </p>
                    <p><em>DON'T PANIC. </p>
                    <p>The weekend has only just begun. . .</em></p>
